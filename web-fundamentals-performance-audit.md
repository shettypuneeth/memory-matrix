# Bottlenecks

- [The payload size](https://blog.std.in/http-response-sizes-and-tcp/) is directly proportional to the time to transfer the content. The rough amount of time it takes to transmit payloads grows exponentially, not accounting for packet loss. It takes a maximum of 1.2 seconds for every round-trip time (RTT) in India on most cellular networks. Assuming no packet loss, 13 KiB is transferred in 1 RTT, 39 KiB takes 2 RTTs, up to 91 KiB can be transmitted in the third RTT, and so on. So itâ€™s no surprise that the lesser the payload, the faster the transfer times.
- [JavaScript bundles](https://medium.com/reloading/javascript-start-up-performance-69200f43b201), especially the ones that are required to initialize the app, suffer with parse and compile times. JavaScript parse/compile times are typically much longer on Android phones compared to iOS phones due to differences in processor architecture and performance. Since JavaScript is parsed/compiled on a single core, it takes longer to bootstrap larger bundles on Android phones, which are the most prevalent in India.
