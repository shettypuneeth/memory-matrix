### Vulnerability vs Exploits

`Vulnerability is when you figure out that you get the host to do something that's not expected. But the exploits are when you weaponize the vulnerability and deploy a hack to take undue advantage.`

### Examples of attacks

- Spam
- DoS
- Malware
- Data theft

### Web security

Same origin policy at the core of the web security.

### Why is it hard?

- Run un-trusted code securely
- Different sites running on the same tab
- Hardware access like GPU
- APIs were not designed with security and current exploits in mind
- Requires backwards compatibility
